# Word Clouds (in R) Based on Grant Application Data

This application takes data scraped from the Scottish Government website which provided narrative for all successful applications for their flagship funding scheme for small-scale climate change mitigation efforts, the Climate Challenge Fund. Scraped data I used is provided in "data". 

This is a simple script which basically takes this data, tidies it up and then generates a spatially accurate word cloud using the remaining terms. In this case the final result was quite revealing!
